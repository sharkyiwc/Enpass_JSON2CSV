Hello,
Here is a PowerShell script to convert an Enpass JSON file to CSV.
I created it to migrate from Enpass to NordPass.

The script asks for the path and name of the JSON file, and everything else is done automatically.
A CSV file will be created in the same folder as the source JSON file, with the current date.

Download the .ps1 script. Make sure you have execution rights, otherwise, use the .BAT file which will run the .ps1 script with the -ExecutionPolicy Bypass argument.

I'm sharing it in case it can help someone.
