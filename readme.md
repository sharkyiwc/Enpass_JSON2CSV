Here is a PowerShell script to convert an Enpass JSON file to CSV.
I created it to migrate from Enpass to NordPass.

The script asks for the path and name of the JSON file, and everything else is done automatically.
A CSV file will be created in the same folder as the source JSON file, with the current date.

I'm sharing it in case it can help someone.
